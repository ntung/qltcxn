# Introduction: Shelter House Financial Management System
<p>This initiative aims to support House Managers in shelter homes by providing robust tools for managing revenues and expenditures.</p>

<p>The core challenge lies in the financial timeline misalignment: residents receive public housing funds fortnightly, while house operations and expense tracking are handled weekly. This critical timing difference consistently results in discrepancies and mismatches between funds received and funds spent.</p>

<p>To resolve this, we are developing a bespoke, web-based application. This solution will empower House Managers to accurately and efficiently track all financial activities in a way that is tailored specifically to their operational and funding cycles.</p>
